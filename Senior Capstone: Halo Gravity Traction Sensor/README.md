Real-Time Load Monitoring Device for Halo Gravity Traction

1. Project Overview

Halo Gravity Traction (HGT) is a preoperative treatment used for patients with severe scoliosis, where the spine is gradually straightened through continuous upward traction. The treatment is effective, but currently lacks a way to monitor real-time traction loads, especially when patients move between the bed, walker, and wheelchair.

This project addresses that gap by designing a real-time load monitoring device that attaches directly to the halo traction cable and continuously records the applied load. The device enables clinicians to verify that the prescribed traction weight is actually being used, reducing the risk of under-correction, overtreatment, and prolonged therapy.

All project details on scoliosis, traction, clinical workflow, and device testing are sourced from the uploaded project poster. 


2. Background
Scoliosis

Affects 2–3% of the population

Severe cases (>40–50° curvature) often require preoperative traction

Symptoms may include pain, deformity, breathing issues, and limited mobility

Halo Gravity Traction (HGT)

Uses a halo ring attached to the skull and weighted pulleys to apply upward traction

Treatment lasts several weeks to months

Doctors typically check load weekly, relying on patient/caregiver compliance

If the full weight is not applied consistently, clinicians may incorrectly increase the load

3. Clinical Need

There is a clear need for an HGT system that provides:

Continuous, real-time load monitoring

Usage tracking across all patient activities

Accurate data logs for physician review

Verification that the prescribed weight is actually being applied

Current systems do not record real-time data, meaning clinicians rely solely on intermittent visual checks and patient reporting.

4. Our Solution: Real-Time Traction Load Monitoring Device
Key Capabilities

Continuously monitors traction load through an in-line sensor

Logs a full week of data to an SD card for doctor review

Displays real-time weight on an LCD screen

Battery-powered to last the entire treatment period

Easily attaches between halo ring and traction cable

Designed for mobility — works with walker, wheelchair, and bed setups

This system allows clinicians to detect missing traction time and avoid unnecessary weight adjustments.
