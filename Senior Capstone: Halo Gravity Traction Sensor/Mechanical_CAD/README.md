## Design Considerations

### Durability
- Optimized for additive manufacturing  
- Reinforced walls and filleted edges  
- Geometry supports repeated use  

### Fit and Tolerances
- Shell halves include alignment features  
- Internal clearances account for wiring, PCBs, and connectors  
- Tolerances selected for reliable 3D printing  

### Ease of Assembly
- Modular components: front shell, back shell, battery lid  
- Simple fastening system  
- Battery lid allows access without full disassembly  

### Safety and Comfort
- Rounded edges to prevent irritation  
- Fully enclosed wiring  
- Lightweight design for long-term wear

## Recommended Usage

### For 3D Printing
Use the STEP files for slicing or converting to STL.

Recommended print settings:
- Layer height: 0.20 mm  
- Infill: 30–40%  
- Material: PLA or PETG  
- Supports: Only for battery-lid overhangs  

### For Manufacturing or Review
Use the PDF drawings for:
- Dimensions  
- Hole placement  
- Wall thickness  
- Alignment features

## Assembly Overview
1. Print all components  
2. Install electronics into the front shell  
3. Route wiring through designed channels  
4. Attach back shell securely  
5. Insert battery and close with battery lid  
6. Perform functional and safety testing
