Project Overview

Hearing aids often struggle to suppress background noise, reducing speech clarity for users. This project investigates deep learning-based speech enhancement models with the goal of real-time deployment on smartphones to support hearing-impaired individuals.

We evaluate four architectures (CRNN, CNN, RNN, FCNN) from recent literature and compare their performance using speech quality and intelligibility metrics. The project also includes a prototype Android real-time enhancement app.

Our aim is to identify a model that is both accurate and efficient enough for deployment on consumer mobile devices.

🔊 Dataset

Clean speech samples were obtained from a public-domain dataset (TIMIT-style). To create realistic noisy inputs, clean speech was mixed with three noise types:

Babble

Traffic

Machinery

Noise mixtures were created at SNR = −5, 0, +5 dB, then split 70/20/10 into training, validation, and test sets.

Model Architectures

We implemented and evaluated four architectures from published studies:

1. CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network)

STFT → Magnitude Spectrum

Combined convolutional + recurrent layers

Captures both spectral and temporal patterns

Real-time-capable architecture

2. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

Frame segmentation → FFT → Log Power Spectrum

Mel-filterbank + temporal frame concatenation

Efficient for smartphone deployment

Primary model used for full evaluation

3. RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)

Dual-microphone inputs

Extracts real & imaginary STFT components

Recurrent layers model temporal dependencies

4. FCNN (Fully Convolutional Neural Network)

STFT → Log-Power Spectrum

Fully convolutional 2D-to-2D mask estimation

Predicts Ideal Ratio Mask (IRM)

All architectural diagrams are shown in the project poster

⚙️ Methods: Speech Enhancement Pipeline

Across models, the general preprocessing workflow includes:

Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)

Spectral feature extraction

Log-power spectrum

Mel-filterbanks

Real/Imaginary STFT components

Normalization

Context windowing (e.g., 9-frame temporal context for CNN)

Neural network inference

Inverse STFT / mask application

A general SE pipeline diagram is provided in the poster (Fig. 1)

Computing Environment

All experiments were run in Jupyter Notebook on a Windows 10 workstation with:

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (24 GB, 10,496 CUDA cores)

Intel i9-10850K CPU

128 GB RAM

This enabled stable training of all models, efficient batching, and reproducible experiments.

Results (CNN Model)

The CNN architecture was trained using:

Optimizer: Adam (1×10⁻⁴ learning rate)

Batch size: 4

Early stopping: epoch 12/15

~100k audio windows with 9-frame context

Loss Metrics

MSE: ↓ from ~0.75 → ~0.61

MAE: consistently decreased across epochs

(Figure 7 in the poster shows full training curves.)

Perceptual Speech Quality

PESQ: ↑ from ~1.5 → ~1.9 (out of 4.5)

Indicates noticeably clearer, more natural speech

Speech Intelligibility

STOI: ↑ from ~0.05 → ~0.08

Modest but consistent gains in intelligibility

Spectrogram Analysis

Spectrograms show enhanced speech masks successfully suppressing noise (Fig. 9).

Conclusion

Attention-enhanced CNN reliably improves clarity and naturalness; further tuning is needed to boost intelligibility. Training for CRNN, RNN, and FCNN models is ongoing.

 Future Work

Optimize the best-performing model for low-memory, low-latency real-time deployment

Test across more diverse noise types & acoustic environments

Conduct user studies with hearing-impaired listeners

Explore integration with hearing aid hardware or mobile hearing-aid apps

Retrain on higher-memory devices with larger batch sizes

Improve STOI via model refinement or hybrid architectures
